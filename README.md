# Abstract
In the context of climate change, one of the most challenging problems will be the adaptation to higher temperatures. Some plants can adapt to temperature conditions by generating an epigenetic memory that can be transmitted both meiotically and mitotically. Such a memory represents a mechanism that might increase the phenotypic plasticity to climate change. The goal of this work was to understand the impact of the temperature on the transcriptomic responsiveness of different ecotypes during sexual and asexual reproduction. For that, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of unfolding leaves of four European ecotypes of Fragaria vesca that were reproduced at two contrasting temperatures (i.e., 18 °C and 28 °C) by seed (achenes) for the sexual and stolons through several asexual generations with emphasis on the differential expression of genes that belong to the epigenetic machinery. Our results point to a general transcriptomic response to treatment in the asexual, whereas the impact of the treatment was less clear in the sexually reproduced individuals, possibly because of the stochastic character of recombination during meiosis or by differental creation or erasure of epigenetic marks during embryogenesis and seed development. The most striking finding is the low number of commonly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between ecotypes; this may well reflect the fact that the extent and level of induced phenological change, indicating a memory of the temperature during propagation, differ greatly between them. Moreover, genes related to the epigenetic machinery were mostly upregulated by the elevated temperature treatment in the asexual experiment and downregulated in the sexual, indicate that the epigentic machinery is impacted by the temperature conditions during reproduction but not in an equivalent mode in the two types of reproduction. A significantly higher number of differentially presented splicing event variants was found in asexual compared to sexual reproduction experiment. Several splicing isoforms for important genes, including one SOC1, one LHY and one SVP homolog were predicted.
